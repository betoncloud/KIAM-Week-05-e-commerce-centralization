# Telegram Data Ingestion and Labeling Scripts

This repository contains two Python scripts that allow you to extract messages from Telegram channels, label entities in Amharic text, and save the labeled data in the CoNLL format for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.

## Overview

### 1. **Data Ingestion from Telegram Channels (`ingest_telegram_data.py`)**

This script uses the Telethon library to log into Telegram and fetch messages from a list of predefined channels. It saves the messages, along with metadata (e.g., channel name, message date), in a CSV file.

#### Key Features:
- Logs into Telegram using your API credentials.
- Fetches messages from a list of predefined channels.
- Saves the messages to a `result.csv` file with columns: `Channel Name`, `Message Date`, and `Message`.

### 2. **Labeling Amharic Text (`label_amharic_text.py`)**

This script reads the messages from the CSV file generated by the ingestion script, extracts Amharic text, and labels entities such as products, prices, and locations dynamically using predefined keywords. The output is saved in CoNLL format, which is widely used for NER tasks.

#### Key Features:
- Extracts only Amharic text from the `Message` column of `result.csv`.
- Dynamically labels tokens in Amharic messages (entities like `B-Product`, `B-LOC`, `B-PRICE`, and `O`).
- Saves the labeled data in CoNLL format (`labeled_dataset.conll`).

## Requirements

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.6+
- Required Python libraries:
  - `telethon` – For interacting with the Telegram API.
  - `nest_asyncio` – To enable nested event loops (useful in Jupyter environments).
  - `re` (built-in) – For regex-based processing.

To install the required libraries, run the following:

```bash
pip install telethon nest_asyncio
